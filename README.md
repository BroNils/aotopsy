A Dart AOT snapshot analyzer. Turns `libapp.so` — the compiled Dart code inside a Flutter release APK — into function names, class layouts, call graphs, behavioral signals, and readable pseudocode. No Dart VM, no SDK compilation, no runtime fallback.

> **Fork notice:** AOTopsy is a fork of **unflutter**, originally by **Anthony Zboralski**. The original `zboralski/unflutter` repository is no longer available (removed by the author); a community continuation exists at [`KristijanZic/unflutter`](https://github.com/KristijanZic/unflutter). All credit for the original snapshot parser, cluster deserializer, ARM64 disassembly pipeline, and Ghidra/IDA integration belongs to the original author. AOTopsy extends it with x86_64 support, a native decompiler, whole-program type inference, Frida script generation, and comprehensive documentation.

## What It Recovers

| Output | What it is |
|--------|-----------|
| Function names | The original Dart name for each compiled function |
| Class structures | Field names, byte offsets, inheritance chains |
| Call graph | Direct (BL) and indirect (BLR/dispatch) call edges with provenance |
| String references | Which functions load which string literals from the object pool |
| Behavioral signals | Crypto, network, gambling, SIM, location, WebView, blockchain keyword classification |
| Pseudocode | Architecture-neutral decompiled output from ARM64 or x86_64 machine code |
| Dart Source Export | Whole-project modular `.dart` files reconstructed with classes, fields, and methods |

Supports **ARM64** and **x86_64**. Covers **Dart 2.10 through 3.13** (3.13.2 is the current stable frontier) — every modeled version parses cleanly on both architectures, see [COVERAGE.md](COVERAGE.md).

## Accuracy & Honesty

AOTopsy is measured against ground truth, not asserted. Two properties are enforced by
the test suite on every change:

| Metric | Value | What it means |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| **Name-recovery agreement** | **89.8%** overall (81.3% worst band, ≥ 0.81 gate floor) across 44 ground-truth builds | Recovered function names compared against each build's own ELF `.symtab`, the external ground truth — `TestSymtabDifferential`. Full per-build scoreboard: [BENCHMARK.md](BENCHMARK.md) (`make bench`). |
| **Decompiler syntax validity** | **100%** valid Dart | Every emitted pseudocode function parses as Dart — `TestDecompileQualityCorpus`. |
| **Fabrication rate** | **0%** | The §2 rule: never emit a guessed name, type, or call target as fact. Unknowns render honestly (`indirectCall`, `<unknown>`, `dynamic`). |

The ground-truth twins are real production builds we cannot redistribute, so those
differential gates run **locally**; public CI validates build + unit tests across the
platform matrix (sample-dependent tests skip cleanly when the binary is absent). How every number here is measured (ground truth, metric definitions, reproduction): [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md). See
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for release-binary verification and the honest scope below.

## Quick Start

```bash
make build
./aotopsy libapp.so                    # full pipeline
./aotopsy doctor libapp.so             # quick diagnostic
./aotopsy export-dart --lib libapp.so --out ./lib  # reconstruct entire Dart source project
./aotopsy _debug decompile-native --lib libapp.so --find MyClass  # find and decompile a function
```

See `WORKFLOW.md` for the step-by-step methodology when you have a raw APK and don't know where to start.

## How It Works

AOTopsy treats the Dart AOT snapshot as a deterministic binary grammar. Every byte has exactly one correct interpretation given the right constraints (ELF structure, snapshot magic, version hash, CID table, cluster encoding). The parser applies constraints until only one interpretation survives — no heuristics, no guessing.

The pipeline runs in stages, each a pure function from bytes to structured data:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[libapp.so] --> B[ELF parse]
    B --> C[snapshot region extraction]
    C --> D[version detection]
    D --> E[cluster alloc<br/>object census]
    E --> F[cluster fill<br/>field values, names, strings]
    F --> G[instructions table<br/>code ranges, stub boundaries]
    G --> H{architecture?}
    H -->|ARM64| I[ARM64 disassembly]
    H -->|x86_64| J[x86_64 disassembly]
    I --> K[CFG + call edges<br/>register provenance]
    J --> K
    K --> L[type inference<br/>BLR receiver type resolution]
    L --> M[signal classification<br/>behavioral keyword matching]
    M --> N[JSONL + HTML + DOT<br/>pseudocode output]
```

Two independent backends share the same front half (ELF through cluster fill), then split by architecture: `internal/disasm` for ARM64, `internal/disasm/x86.go` for x86_64. The decompiler (`internal/decompiler`) handles both architectures through a unified IR.

```mermaid

        A[elfx] --> B[snapshot]
        B --> C[cluster]
    end

        C --> D1[disasm ARM64]
        D1 --> E1[callgraph]
        E1 --> F1[signal]
    end
    subgraph "x86_64 backend"

        D2 --> E2[callgraph]
        E2 --> F2[signal]
    end
    subgraph "Decompiler (both archs)"
        C --> G[decompiler IR]
        G --> H[pseudocode]
    end
```

## Comparison With Blutter

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Blutter
        direction TB
        B1[libapp.so] --> B2[Compile matching<br/>Dart SDK]
        B2 --> B3[Embed Dart VM]
        B3 --> B4[Deserialize via<br/>VM internal APIs]
        B4 --> B5[Perfect fidelity]
    end
    subgraph AOTopsy
        direction TB
        A1[libapp.so] --> A2[Parse binary format<br/>directly]
        A2 --> A3[No VM, no SDK]
        A3 --> A4[Version-specific<br/>format modeling]
        A4 --> A5[Portability + speed]
    end
```

[Blutter](https://github.com/worawit/blutter) embeds the Dart VM to deserialize the snapshot through its own code paths. Perfect fidelity, but requires compiling a matching Dart SDK for every target version — and it is ARM64-only, with no static x86_64 support. AOTopsy is the only static, version-independent analyzer with a native pseudocode decompiler and published ground-truth accuracy.

AOTopsy parses the binary format directly. No VM, no SDK. The tradeoff: every format change across Dart versions must be modeled explicitly. There is no runtime to handle it automatically.

## Commands

### Full pipeline

```bash
aotopsy libapp.so              # disasm + call edges + signal + metadata (ARM64: + Ghidra/IDA)
aotopsy signal libapp.so       # same, skip metadata
aotopsy libapp.so --graph      # also build call graph DOT files
```

Flags: `--out <dir>` (default: `<basename>.aotopsy/`), `--quiet`, `--strict`, `--max-steps <n>`, `--k <n>` (signal context depth, default 2).

### Diagnostic

```bash
aotopsy doctor libapp.so       # Dart version, pointer size, support status, build features
aotopsy find-libapp --apk app.apk  # locate libapp.so inside an APK
```

### Whole-Project Dart Source Export

Reconstructs all classes, fields, methods, getters, setters, and constructors into modular `.dart` files mapped by original library URIs:

```bash
aotopsy export-dart --lib libapp.so --out ./reconstructed_lib/   # full project export
aotopsy export-dart --lib libapp.so --out ./lib/ --app-only      # filter out core/flutter framework
aotopsy export-dart --lib libapp.so --out ./lib/ --filter Auth   # targeted export by name
```

### High-Level Native Decompiler (ARM64 + x86_64)

Produces clean, idiomatic Dart code directly from binary machine instructions:
- **Structural Control Flow**: `for-in` iterators, `while`, `for`, `try-catch-finally` with exact PC bounding.
- **Async/Await Linearization**: Unwraps `_SuspendState` state machines into linear `await future` and `await for`.
- **Lambda Inlining**: Synthesizes arrow callbacks `(item) => process(item)` directly at call sites.
- **Type Lattice**: Propagates concrete Dart types (`String`, `int`, `UserModel`) across SSA values without running a live VM.
- **Dart Idioms**: Null-aware (`?.`, `??`, `??=`), cascade (`..`), Set/List/Map literals, string interpolation (`"${a}${b}"`).

```bash
aotopsy _debug decompile-native --lib libapp.so --find MyClass         # locate by name
aotopsy _debug decompile-native --lib libapp.so --func 0x1a92728       # one function at a VA
aotopsy _debug decompile-native --lib libapp.so --from-main --out out/ # reachability from app entry
aotopsy _debug decompile-native --lib libapp.so --all --filter MyClass # bulk, filtered
```

Warning: `--all` without a small `--max` can require ~64GB RAM on a real app. Prefer `--find`/`--func`/`--from-main`.

### Ghidra / IDA (ARM64 only)

```bash
aotopsy ghidra libapp.so        # headless Ghidra with metadata injection
aotopsy ida libapp.so           # headless IDA via idalib
```

Both reject x86_64 input. Use `decompile-native` for x86_64 pseudocode.

### Frida script generation

```bash
aotopsy _debug decompile-native --lib libapp.so --func 0x1a92728 --gen-frida --gen-frida-out hooks.js
frida -U -f com.example.app -l hooks.js --no-pause
```

See `FRIDA.md` for the full guide.

### Cross-referencing and tracing

```bash
aotopsy _debug strings --lib libapp.so --find "X-Signature" --xref   # which function loads this string?
aotopsy _debug ffi-trace --lib libapp.so --filter MyClass            # dart:ffi call sites
aotopsy _debug dispatch-table --lib libapp.so --filter MyClass       # dispatch table entries
aotopsy _debug fingerprint --lib libapp.so                           # build-id and version markers
aotopsy _debug funcdiff --old old.so --new new.so                    # function set diff
aotopsy _debug symbolmap --stripped lib.so --unstripped debug.so     # resolve stripped targets
```

### Corpus tools

```bash
aotopsy inventory --dir samples/                    # catalog APKs
aotopsy parity --samples samples/ --out out/        # cross-version parse report
aotopsy _debug thr-audit -lib libapp.so -out thr.jsonl  # THR access scan
```

## Build

Requires Go 1.25+.

```bash
make build      # build ./aotopsy
make install    # install to ~/.aotopsy/bin
make test       # run tests
```

Integration tests use environment variables (`AOTOPSY_TEST_SAMPLE_*`) to locate sample binaries — they skip automatically if not set.

## Releases & Branches

AOTopsy uses a two-branch model:

| Branch | Role |
|--------|------|
| `main` | **Stable.** Every commit is a squash-merged, gate-verified release candidate. Tagged releases (with prebuilt cross-platform binaries) are cut from here. |
| `develop` | **Rolling / nightly.** Where day-to-day small commits, features, and research land first. May be unstable between merges. Batched into `main` via a squash-merge PR once the gates are green. |

Contribute against `develop`; open a PR into `main` only when a batch of work is gate-verified.

Prebuilt binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows (amd64/arm64) are attached to each
[GitHub release](../../releases). AOTopsy is pure Go, so `make build` cross-compiles cleanly for any target.

## Limitations & Scope

AOTopsy states plainly what it does and does not recover. Some limits are engineering
scope; others are **hard AOT-format floors** — information the Dart compiler removes in
release (PRODUCT) builds, verified against the SDK source. We document floors rather than
fabricating over them.

**Hard AOT floors (verified — do not expect these to improve):**
- **Instance field names are ~97–99% absent.** `Precompiler::DropFields` keeps field
  names only under `#if !defined(PRODUCT)`; a real app has ~233 named `Field` objects vs
  ~16k synthetic. Accessor-based recovery (`get:`/`set:` still carry the name) pierces
  this partially (−11–22%, deterministic, never guessed); the rest is genuinely gone.
- **Local and captured variable names are gone.** Rendered as `local_*` / `tN`.
- **Truly polymorphic dispatch targets are not statically resolvable.** BLR through a
  dispatch table / dynamic `Closure` object is an AOT limit, not an analysis gap; these
  render honestly as `indirectCall` / `dynamicCall`. See `docs/roadmap/20-invariants-and-non-defects.md`.

**Engineering scope:**
- **AOT only.** No JIT support.
- **Ghidra/IDA decompilation is ARM64-only.** x86_64 is rejected with a clear error — use `decompile-native` instead (the only static x86_64 Flutter decompiler).
- **`--all` decompilation can crash the host.** A real full-size app needs ~64GB RAM for unbounded `--all`. Use targeted modes (`--find`, `--func`, `--from-main`) or cap with `--max`.
- **Virtual dispatch is invisible to `--from-main` reachability.** Widget lifecycle callbacks go through Flutter's framework dispatch, not direct call instructions. A class-touch heuristic recovers some, but it's an over-approximation. Use Frida for the rest.
- **Every Dart version change must be modeled.** There is no VM to handle format changes automatically. The snapshot carries a git-derived hash, not a version number, so support is structure-based. Currently modeled: Dart 2.10 → 3.13.
- **Ground-truth twins are not redistributable** (real production builds), so the
  name-recovery differential runs locally, not in public CI.
